		<h2>Updates</h2>

		<h3>2. Week of May 23rd: Discussion and Preparation</h3>
		<p class="text">We review the basics and the importance of deep learning and reinforcement
		learning with the professor (back propagation, overfitting, etc.). We then discuss about the
		upcoming tasks that need to accomplish in order to be familiar with reinforcement learning.
		I decide to start with simple projects that are related with reinforcement learning.</p>

		<p class="text">Once I have completed some small projects, we then decide to work on the main project, which
		is morphology traning across different environments (expanding generalization of RL). If we have more
		time in the future, we can try to train with a fixed training data (off-policy idea). </p>

		<h3>1. Week of May 16th: Title and Abstract</h3>
		<p class="text"> We start by discussing the topic of the project. We have found one paper
		that talks about the concept of improving reinforcement learning with morphology-agnostic
		learning. The tasks that we've decided to train on were not confirmed yet, but we're going
		to use this paper as inspiration for this project. I've found some ideas that I can use as
		different tasks to train on different agents, like playing chess, the Atari Game, or
		training humanoids for control tasks (application of morphology-agnostic learning), but these
		are all brainstormed ideas for now.</p>
