<p class="text">
    Reinforcement learning is a method that focuses on the interaction of the agent and
    its environment based on different actions. The challenge here is to optimize a policy
    containing the best series of actions to take given a state in order to maximize the chance
    of getting a reward. However, rewards aren’t present in every action. They are quite sparse
    throughout the experiment, which makes it very difficult to distinguish between positive and
    negative actions. As such, we need a lot of data and examples to train the agent. Furthermore,
    reinforcement learning can easily lead to overfitting since the agent is trained in a restricted
    number of environments. In other words, the agent is mostly “memorizing” different actions in a
    specific environment, which can significantly decrease the agent’s performance in a new
    environment. Instead, we want to create agents that learn and generalize to similar tasks.
    These agents are more useful in the real world since they are not only learning about a
    specific task, but also have the capacity to reuse their experience for different future goals,
    which can lead to more flexibility in terms of objectives. In this project,
    we will improve on new machine learning methods that train agents to perform well on different
    tasks in an environment where they haven’t gathered prior experience.
