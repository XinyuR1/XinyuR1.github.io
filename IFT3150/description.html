<!-- TITLE -->
<p> <b>Title: </b> Extending Generalization in Reinforcement Learning</p>

<p class="text">
    <b>Topic of the project:</b><br>
    I decided to fully focus on the concept of generalization using different Atari environments since I
    already wrote two different CNN policies for different Atari environments.<br>
    <br>
    The goal here is to experiment on three different environments using CNN policy. The agent trains
    on three different games and it needs to learn the fourth game by itself (a new game that the agent
    has never seen before) based on its experience.

<b>Programming Language:</b> Python 3.7<br><br>
<b>Libraries:</b> <br>
- Open AI, stable-baselines3, Pytorch<br>
- rlkit: Library for Reinforcement Learning Algorithms<br>
- doodad: Library for running experiments on different computers<br>
