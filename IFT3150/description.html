    Description of the Project

<h2>Title of the Project</h2>
<p>Extending Generalization in Reinforcement Learning</p>
<hr class="style">

<h2>Topic of the Project</h2>
<p class="text">
    I decided to fully focus on the concept of generalization using different Atari environments since I
    already wrote two different CNN policies for different Atari environments.<br>
    <br>
    Generalization usually means to be able to perform well on similar unseen tasks. We realize that the standard reinforcement learning only uses one environment to train the agent, which
    can facilite overfitting. Therefore, by extending the concept of generalization, we decide to introduce
    different environments (tasks) to the agent in order to learn more efficiently a new Atari environment
    (motivation of meta reinforcement learning). Our goal is here to let
    the agent train on three different games and it needs to learn the fourth game by itself based on its
    trained policy.

</p><br>
<hr class="style">

<h2>IDEs and Software Used in This Project</h2>
<p class="text">
    <li>Pycharm: For debugging issues related to preprocessing of Atari environments and local experiments.</li>
    <li>VSCode with ssh extension: For debugging actual Atari experiments while connecting to the lab computers.</li>
    <li>Docker: For running experiments inside a nvidia-docker image.</li>
</p><br>

<h2>Setup for Experiments</h2>
<p class="text">
    <li>Which computers are you working on? <br>
        Local: Virtual Machine Ubuntu version 22.04 <br>
        Lab Computer: Glen's lab computers (Blue and Green) accessed through ssh with a GPU (NVIDIA RTX A4000)
    </li><br>

    <li>How do you execute an experiment? <br>
        In the remote computer, I created a nvidia-docker image for my Atari experiment and I run the python
        file by using that image.
    </li>
