<h2>4. Week of June 14th: Rlkit and DQN Learning</h2>
<p class="text">TBC. </p>
<hr class="style">

<h2>3. Weeks of May 30th and June 6th: Foundation of RL</h2>
<p class="text">I start by taking notes about the basics of reinforcement learning. The lectures that I
    listened are given by professor Steven Brunton. The lectures give an overview of numerous RL methods that
    are model-based and model-free. I've decided to focus on the algorithm of Q-learning and DQN, since it
    will be useful for the main project. Since the mathematics and the logic behind the algorithms are quite
    complex, I've decided to link other papers or online tutorials that will explain deeply some of the concepts
    that I find interesting (i.e. Q-Learning). </p>

<p class="text">In terms of implementation, I start by using the <mark>stable-baseline3</mark> package and OpenAI. I will
    complete three small projects before diving into the concept of generalization in RL: Atari Game,
    Autonomous Driving and Creating a custom environment with Gym libraries.</p>


Milestones:
<br>
<li>
    June 12th: Theory about Reinforcement Learning and Small RL projects complete
</li>
<br>

<h2>2. Week of May 23rd: Discussion and Preparation</h2>
<p class="text">We review the basics and the importance of deep learning and reinforcement
    learning with the professor (back propagation, overfitting, etc.). We then discuss about the
    upcoming tasks that need to accomplish in order to be familiar with reinforcement learning.
    I decide to start with simple projects that are related with reinforcement learning.</p>

<p class="text">Once I have completed some small projects, we then decide to work on the main project, which
    is morphology traning across different environments (expanding generalization of RL). If we have more
    time in the future, we can try to train with a fixed training data (off-policy idea). </p>
<hr class="style">

<h2>1. Week of May 16th: Title and Abstract</h2>
<p class="text"> We start by discussing the topic of the project. We have found one paper
    that talks about the concept of improving reinforcement learning with morphology-agnostic
    learning. The tasks that we've decided to train on were not confirmed yet, but we're going
    to use this paper as inspiration for this project. I've found some ideas that I can use as
    different tasks to train on different agents, like playing chess, the Atari Game, or
    training humanoids for control tasks (application of morphology-agnostic learning), but these
    are all brainstormed ideas for now.</p>

Milestones:
<br>
<li>May 16th: Beginning of the Project</li>
