<h2>Workload 3 - Atari</h2>

<p class="text">
    During the previous workload, I was testing the rlkit code with DQN-Cartpole (Project I), but no changes
    were made in the actual code. The professor and I have decided to work on another small
    project (exercise), by modifying some parts of the code: (1) Change the Cartpole environment into
    an Atari one (Breakout), (2) Preprocess the images from the breakout game, (3) Create a new policy
    from scratch using Pytorch CNN.
</p>

<p class="text">
    In order to prepare for the implementation in Pytorch, I followed a playlist of Pytorch tutorials
    (until workload 5). This also helps me to revise the basics of deep learning and backpropagation.
    In this workload, I suggested two different CNN Policies for the training of Breakout Game that are shown
    in the figure (at the end of this block). The plots for the training aren't done since this workload
    was mainly focused on building a CNN Policy. For the Atari Breakout mini-project, our next goal is
    to test the two models with a large number of epochs with CPU and GPU.
</p>

<p class="text">
    We also had a brief introduction to Dockerfile this week, a topic that will be covered in the next workload.

<h2>Workload 2 - DQN</h2>

    This section of workload focuses on gathering information that is related to the project, which
    is expanding the concept of generalization in RL. I've found two papers that mainly talk about DQN
    algorithm that is applied in multiple situations: the first paper talks about fluid mechanics,
    whereas the second one talks about the Atari Environment. Furthermore, we have found a paper
    that mainly talks about generalization in RL with zero-policy transfer. In terms of readings,
    the goal for the upcoming weeks is to find papers that talks more about multi-task and hierarchical
    learning.
</p>

<p class="text">
    I also start testing the RLKIT package by testing the DQN Algorithm with the cartpole environment.
    The RLKIT package mainly uses PyTorch to implement different methods, so I've decided
    to apply the same principles but with another library, which is stable-baseline3.

    - Based on the value loss plot, we can see that the agent starts to learn between 0-25k timesteps and then the function decreases once the reward is stabilized.
    <br>- Based on the policy gradient loss plot, we can see a sudden drop in 35k timesteps, which means the training is successful during this specific amount of timesteps. We observe that the loss increases significantly once it reaches over 35k timesteps.
    <br>- Based on the explained variance, at 35k timesteps, the value is 0.9633, which is the highest value of explained variance in the plot. However, it is still not superior to 1, which means our PPO model can be improved with other alternatives.

<h2>Workload 1 - Basics of RL</h2>

<p class="text">
    Weeks of May 30th and June 6th <br>
    <b>Deadline</b>: June 12th
</p>

<p class="text">I start by taking notes about the basics of reinforcement learning. The lectures that I
    listened are given by professor Steven Brunton. The lectures give an overview of numerous RL methods that
    are model-based and model-free. I've decided to focus on the algorithm of Q-learning and DQN, since it
    will be useful for the main project. Since the mathematics and the logic behind the algorithms are quite
    complex, I've decided to link other papers or online tutorials that will explain deeply some of the concepts
    that I find interesting (i.e. Q-Learning). </p>

<p class="text">In terms of implementation, I start by using the <mark>stable-baseline3</mark> package and OpenAI. I will
    complete three small projects before diving into the concept of generalization in RL: Atari Game,
    Autonomous Driving and Creating a custom environment with Gym libraries.</p>

<h2>Discussion and Preparation</h2>

<p class="text">
    Week of May 23rd <br>
</p>

<p class="text">We review the basics and the importance of deep learning and reinforcement
    learning with the professor (back propagation, overfitting, etc.). We then discuss about the
    upcoming tasks that need to accomplish in order to be familiar with reinforcement learning.
    I decide to start with simple projects that are related with reinforcement learning.</p>

<p class="text">Once I have completed some small projects, we then decide to work on the main project, which
    is morphology traning across different environments (expanding generalization of RL). If we have more
    time in the future, we can try to train with a fixed training data (off-policy idea). </p>

<h2>Title and Abstract</h2>

<p class="text">
    Week of May 16th <br>
    <b>Deadline</b>: May 20th
</p>

<p class="text"> We start by discussing the topic of the project. We have found one paper
    that talks about the concept of improving reinforcement learning with morphology-agnostic
    learning. The tasks that we've decided to train on were not confirmed yet, but we're going
    to use this paper as inspiration for this project. I've found some ideas that I can use as
    different tasks to train on different agents, like playing chess, the Atari Game, or
    training humanoids for control tasks (application of morphology-agnostic learning), but these
    are all brainstormed ideas for now.</p>
